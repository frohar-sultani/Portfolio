    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Frohar Sultani â€” someone who seeks meaning, depth, and beauty in life and work. I originally studied Islamic Studies, but lifeâ€™s journey led me to the world of technology and web design.</p>
      <p>Over the past years, I have always been drawn to silence and calmness; a silence that empowers and creates space for ideas to grow and focus to deepen. I believe silence is not just the absence of sound, but a mindful presence that helps us understand ourselves and the world better.</p>
      <p>Alongside this, my personal brand, <strong>Lady Qaleen Baf</strong>, is a project aimed at supporting Afghan women and empowering them through handcrafted carpet weaving. For me, this brand is not just a business, but a mission to create positive and lasting change in the lives of these strong and talented women.</p>
      <p>My passion for web design and coding, combined with deep human values, drives me to build websites that express identity, culture, and ideals â€” designs that are both beautiful and meaningful.</p>
      <p>Through my learning journey in SheCodes and Educatalyst programs, I have faced many challenges, but each step has made me stronger and more determined to shine as an independent and creative web designer.</p>
      <p>My goal is to create beauty and meaning that leaves a positive impact on the world around me and to amplify the voices of Afghan women to a global audience.</p>
      <p>My interests go beyond design; I love nature, silence, reading, and content creation, always striving to maintain a deep balance between my personal and professional life.</p>
      <p>Here are my short-term and long-term goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To become a recognized and independent web designer.</li>
        <li>To empower Afghan women through my brand and social projects.</li>
        <li>To build a life that is meaningful, energetic, and inspiring.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope with faith, creativity, and effort, to help build a better and brighter world where art, technology, and humanity overlap.</p>
